# overlay-scrollbar
a solution that works on apple and chrome and fits my angular 18 prj (i had dependency conflicts with overlay scrollbars npm package

- Currently only vertical scroll is implemented 
- It does theming based upon URL you can remove that or do it as well
- Its a coppy from a work project, but shared out of frustration of Apple, no guides nothing just enforcing style upon web devs.. thats not nice.

I'd like to point out that there are other scrollbars too that work, and they probaply use the same technique
The difference is their maintained, (this wil not be maintained, as it has no dependencies other then Angular 18, probaply works on older versions too).

The key thing to search for will then be 'overlay' scroll bars as this is essentially what it does, hide original and draw your own div on top of it.
If only Apple kept supporting webkit as in the older times it be less of a hassle.
